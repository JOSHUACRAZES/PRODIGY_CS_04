PRODIGY_CS_04 SIMPLE KEYLOGGER

A keylogger tool is a software program designed to secretly record every keystroke made on a computer or mobile device. These tools operate silently in the background, capturing not only the characters typed but also additional context such as which applications or websites the keystrokes were entered into. Keyloggers may come with additional features like taking screenshots, logging clipboard contents, and transmitting captured data to a remote server controlled by the attacker. While some keyloggers serve legitimate purposes like employee monitoring or parental control, others are used for malicious activities such as stealing passwords and sensitive information for identity theft or espionage. Detecting and preventing keyloggers can be challenging, but users can protect themselves by using reputable antivirus software, being cautious about software downloads, and keeping their systems updated with the latest security patches.
